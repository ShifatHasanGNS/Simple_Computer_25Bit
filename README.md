# Simple_Computer_25Bit

It's a `Simple Computer` that can load a program to perform several mathematical and logical operations. And, it's one of my `Academic Projects`.

## Please Pay Attention

- Use `Logisim Evolution` to Open the Circuit File.
- Use `translator.py` to translate program, if needed.
  - I've made this translator to translate a program to Machine Code that the Computer can work with.
- To Translate / Compile:
  - ```bash
    python translator.py <source_file> <output_file>
    ```
